# Dungeoncrawler
This is the rewrite of a previous project I was working on. I did this because the old project had many, *many* critical flaws in the code. This new version is simpler, more intuitive, and has more dynamic code for future updates. 

# Current State of the Project (8/25)
The game is in a playable state, although it is very incomplete. I'm currently working on switching over to Swing from the terminal.

# Future Plans
Although I have many things I want to add to the game, it is time consuming to add them. I'm currently a student, and my classes take priority over this project. That being said, I have no plans to drop this project any time soon, and would like to continue working on it until it's at least playable. Here are some things I'm currently planning on implementing*:
- Currency system
- ~~Proper chest rarity generation~~ - Added as of 4/20
- Sidequests
- Bosses
- Unique dungeons
- ~~Unique NPC's~~ - Added as of 4/18
- More enemy variety
- ~~Some ASCII art so the terminal doesn't look so dry~~ - Added as of 4/19
- Functional shops (they don't sell anything currently)
- Random events while exploring
- Leveling system
- Proper player class system with different functionalities
- Player stats having an impact on gameplay
- A way for the player to move around in a dungeon
- ~~Implement ticks for updating certain events regardless of player input/current state~~ - Added as of 4/21
- A proper GUI instead of the terminal
- And more to come...  
_*Regardless of whether something is crossed out, I will continue changing all of these_
# Disclaimer
I'm relatively new to Java, which means my knowledge of how to code certain things is limited. AI has been used in this project to code some things. Most notably the Gson adapters are completely AI generated. I understand how they work, but I do not think I would be able to code them myself.
